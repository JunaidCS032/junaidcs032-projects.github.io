## Simple means Faster: Real-Time Human Motion Forecasting in Monocular First Person Videos on CPU

<b>Accepted</b> in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2020

<p>
  In this work we present a simple, fast, and light-weight RNN based framework for forecasting future locations 
  of humans in first person monocular videos. The primary motivation for this work was to design a network which 
  could accurately predict future trajectories at a very high rate of ~78 trajectories per second on a CPU.
